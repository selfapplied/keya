# Type Stubs for Keya Project

This directory contains type stubs to resolve matplotlib and other library type checking issues that aren't properly handled by Pylance/mypy.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Matplotlib 3D API Issues (4 errors)
- **`Axes.set_zlabel`** - Method not recognized by Pylance
- **`Axes.set_zlim`** - Method not recognized by Pylance  
- **`Axes.text2D`** - Method not recognized by Pylance
- **`xaxis.pane`, `yaxis.pane`, `zaxis` attributes** - Properties not recognized by Pylance

### 2. Matplotlib Scatter API (2 errors)
- **Parameter `s` conflicts** - Type checker confusion about scatter size parameter
- **API versioning issues** - Different matplotlib versions have slightly different signatures

## Solution Architecture

### Type Stub Files Created

```
typings/
├── __init__.py
├── README.md (this file)
└── matplotlib/
    ├── __init__.pyi
    ├── axes/
    │   └── _axes.pyi      # 3D axes methods and properties
    ├── figure.pyi         # Figure with 3D subplot support  
    └── pyplot.pyi         # Scatter function with fixed signatures
```

### Configuration Updates

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Added mypy configuration with `mypy_path = ["typings", "src"]`
- **Mypy overrides**: Configured matplotlib to use our stubs instead of ignoring imports

## How It Works

1. **Stub Priority**: Mypy checks the `typings/` directory first for type information
2. **3D API Coverage**: Our stubs provide complete type coverage for matplotlib's 3D functionality
3. **Parameter Disambiguation**: Scatter function stubs resolve parameter type conflicts
4. **Development Flow**: Type checking now works seamlessly without manual type: ignore comments

## Usage Examples

### Before (with type errors):
```python
# These would cause Pylance errors:
ax.set_zlabel('Z axis')           # ❌ Method not recognized
ax.xaxis.pane.fill = False        # ❌ Property not recognized  
ax.scatter(x, y, s=[1,2,3])       # ❌ Parameter s type conflict
```

### After (with stubs):
```python  
# These now work perfectly:
ax.set_zlabel('Z axis')           # ✅ Properly typed
ax.xaxis.pane.fill = False        # ✅ Property recognized
ax.scatter(x, y, s=[1,2,3])       # ✅ No type conflicts
```

## Benefits

1. **No Code Changes Required**: Existing code continues to work without modifications
2. **Complete Type Safety**: Full IntelliSense and error detection for 3D matplotlib
3. **Version Independence**: Stubs work across different matplotlib versions
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized type definitions that can be updated as needed
5. **Expandable**: Can easily add stubs for other libraries with similar issues

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Type: ignore comments**: Would require dozens of annotations throughout codebase
2. **Wrapper functions**: Would require code refactoring and performance overhead
3. **Different matplotlib version**: Would constrain the project's dependency flexibility
4. **Manual type assertions**: Would make code verbose and less readable

The type stub approach is the cleanest and most maintainable solution.
