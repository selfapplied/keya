The Keya Project is committed to fostering reinvestment and locality in 
software development. This license ensures that:

1. Any improvements or modifications to Keya must be shared back with 
   the community (reinvestment principle)
   
2. Organizations using Keya in network services must provide source 
   code to their users (transparency principle)
   
3. The commons-based development model prevents extractive relationships
   where value is taken without contribution back to the ecosystem
