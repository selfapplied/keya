ðŸŒŸ KERNEL-POWERED CELLULAR AUTOMATA WITH ATTRACTOR DETECTION ðŸŒŸ

This module demonstrates that Conway's Game of Life can be implemented as a
special case of the KÃ©ya engine's PascalKernel. More importantly, it shows
that the simulation can be run until it reaches a stable attractor (a still
life or an oscillator), which is then classified.
